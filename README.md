# currencycounter

INTRODUCTION:
It is difficult to keep track of money that we remove from our wallets every day.
Making some kind of system to aid in remembering the amount in our wallet would be much
helpful. Currency counter will enable us to count money accurately and in turn prevent us
from becoming a spendthrift.[1]

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To develop a Arduino system to calculate the currency notes and calculate their
amount by sensing paper currency using colour sensor and Arduino and to show the
remaining balance on 16*2 LCD.[1]

COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
Arduino Uno
Arduino Uno Mega cable USB 2.0
GY-31 TCS320 colour sensor
Male to male jumper wire for breadboard
Male to female jumper wire for breadboard
IR proximity sensor
Breadboard 840 Tie Points MB-102
16*2 alphanumeric LCD

CHALLENGES FACED:
The frequency of the colours of the note changed with the distance between the sensor
and the currency note.
The interference of room light in the calculation of the frequency of colours.
The difference in colours and frequencies between old and new notes.
The difference in colours and frequencies between unused and used notes.
